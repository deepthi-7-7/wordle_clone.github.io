# wordle-clone-website
created a wordle website using HTML, CSS, JS
This is a basic clone of wordle website website which is inspired by the original website of "THE NEWYORK TIMES".
1.Game Interface: The website would likely feature a clean and user-friendly interface where players can interact with the game.
It would display the five-letter word that needs to be guessed and provide a space for players to enter their guesses.
2.Feedback and Scoring: After each guess, the website would provide feedback to the player, 
indicating which letters are correct and in the correct position (marked with green) or correct but in the wrong position (marked with yellow).
It might also display the number of remaining attempts and track the player's score based on their performance.
