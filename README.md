# Clone Wordle

This project is a clone of the popular word-guessing game called Wordle. It has been developed using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows players to guess a five-letter word by inputting their guesses and receiving feedback on their progress.

## How to Play

1. **Objective**: The objective of the game is to guess the five-letter word selected by the computer.

2. **Guessing**: Enter your guess into the input field provided. The guess must consist of five letters.

3. **Feedback**: After each guess, the game will provide feedback on your progress:
   - A letter in green indicates that the letter is in the correct position.
   - A letter in yellow indicates that the letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
   - A gray letter indicates that the letter is not in the word.

4. **Limited Attempts**: You have a limited number of attempts to guess the word. The number of attempts allowed is displayed at the top of the game screen.

5. **Winning**: If you correctly guess the word within the allowed attempts, you win the game.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `wordle.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the game and includes CSS and JavaScript files.
